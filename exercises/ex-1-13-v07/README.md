## Prompt: Todo app with persisten volume with more functionality
    -   For the project we'll need to do some coding to start seeing results in the next part.
    -   Add an input field. The input should not take todos that are over 140 characters long.
    -   Add a send button. It does not have to send the todo yet.
    -   Add a list for the existing todos with some hardcoded todos.


## Get started: Copy directory ex-1-12-v06 as ex-1-13-v07.

## Hint
- Update todo app to include the features as requested.

## Test
    - If http://localhost:8081/ root page shows an image and todo app, then we know it works. Refresh after 10 seconds and view the updated image.

## Notes:
    - I do not understand instructions fully, so I updated the prompt to how I understand it.

## Solution
    - cd to this directory, run `make relaunch-cluster` and check http://localhost:8081/ and check again after 10 seconds to see the updated image.
